# \# DevOps++

# 

# DevOps++ is an open-source framework for building \*\*sustainable, efficient, and resilient\*\* software systems. It extends traditional DevOps by embedding practical principles and CI/CD workflows that reduce waste, control performance and energy regressions, and improve long-term operational durability.

# 

# \## Documentation

# 

# See the \*\*Wiki\*\* for principles, CI/CD playbooks, and case studies.

# 

# \## Quick Start

# 

# \- \*\*Explore the Principles\*\* (P1–P10) to understand the core methodology and design intent.

# \- \*\*Try the Examples\*\* to apply the workflows in CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code.

# \- \*\*Contribute\*\* improvements, patterns, and lessons learned via `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

# 

# \## Why DevOps++?

# 

# Because inefficiency compounds. Persistent background activity, unnecessary I/O, oversized allocations, and uncontrolled retries drive recurring cost, degrade reliability through tail-latency amplification, and increase energy use. DevOps++ helps teams ship software that is not only fast, but also \*\*measurably efficient\*\*, \*\*operationally stable\*\*, and \*\*aligned with user value\*\*.
