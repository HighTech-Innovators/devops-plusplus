# Principle 8: Embrace Lightweight Execution With WebAssembly

**Problem**: Traditional runtimes can be heavy for small, fast, or stateless functions.  

**DevOps++ Solution**:  
Adopt **WebAssembly (Wasm)** for lightweight, portable, and secure execution.  
- Treat Wasm modules as first-class code assets.  
- Ideal for serverless and edge environments.  

**Benefits**:  
- Faster build and deployment cycles.  
- Lower runtime overhead.  
- Secure sandboxed execution.
