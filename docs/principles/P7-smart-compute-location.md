# Principle 7: Choose Compute Location Intelligently

**Problem**: Teams assume all compute belongs in the cloud.  
- High latency workloads suffer.  
- Data sovereignty or carbon intensity concerns are ignored.  

**DevOps++ Solution**:  
Simulate workloads across cloud, edge, and client-side to decide **optimal placement**.  

**Benefits**:  
- Lower latency for users.  
- Compliance with sovereignty requirements.  
- Lower emissions in renewable-heavy regions.
