# Principle 9: Tie Performance Thresholds to Perception, Not Tradition

**Problem**: Legacy performance thresholds are often arbitrary.  
- Metrics don’t reflect user experience.  

**DevOps++ Solution**:  
Use **real user monitoring (RUM)** and **perceptual latency modeling** to align performance targets with what users actually feel.  

**Benefits**:  
- More meaningful performance improvements.  
- Prioritization of fixes that impact users directly.
