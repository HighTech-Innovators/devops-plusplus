# Principle 5: Validate Performance Early, Not Post-Deployment

**Problem**: Performance testing often happens late (just before go-live).  
- Late fixes delay releases.  
- Performance regressions slip into production.  

**DevOps++ Solution**:  
Shift performance testing left — into the **pull request stage**.  
- Run mock infrastructure simulations.  
- Catch misfit workloads early.  

**Benefits**:  
- Saves developer time.  
- Reduces cost of rework.  
- Prevents user-facing performance issues.
