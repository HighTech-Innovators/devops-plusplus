# Principle 10: Measure Efficiency in User Terms

**Problem**: Traditional ops metrics focus on raw system throughput.  

**DevOps++ Solution**:  
Adopt **Operations per User Action (OPUA)** as a core metric.  
- Measures how much work the system performs per user action.  
- Encourages teams to simplify and optimize flows.  

**Benefits**:  
- Clear visibility into system efficiency.  
- Lower costs per unit of user value delivered.  
- Sustainability through reduced energy and compute per action.
