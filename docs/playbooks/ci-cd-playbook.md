# CI/CD Playbook for DevOps++

This playbook integrates sustainability and efficiency into CI/CD workflows.

## Steps
1. **Detect inefficiencies**: Use AI analytics or observability to find idle compute, bottlenecks, or oversized workloads.
2. **Integration tests**: Run scenarios that reveal energy and resource inefficiencies.
3. **IaC auto-fixes**: Update Kubernetes YAML or Terraform automatically with right-sizing recommendations.
4. **Validation**: Involve Ops + FinOps to confirm in staging and production.

## Benefits
- Lower costs (FinOps)
- Reduced CO₂ emissions (Sustainability)
- Higher reliability (Ops)
- Faster delivery (Dev)
